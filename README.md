📚 Introduction to Databases in Back-End Web Development
A comprehensive guide to understanding, querying, and integrating SQL databases with Python for back-end applications.

🎯 Overview
This repository provides a hands-on introduction to relational databases, focusing on MySQL, and how they are utilized in back-end web development. 
You will learn the fundamental concepts, master SQL query language, and practice integrating a database with a Python application.

🌟 Topics Covered
The course is structured around the following key modules:

1. Introduction to Databases
•	What is a database and why is it essential for web applications?
•	Database Management Systems (DBMS) and their role.
•	Key concepts: Schema, Table, Record, Field.

3. Types of Databases
•	Relational Databases (SQL): Key characteristics (ACID properties), examples (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
•	Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL): Key characteristics (BASE properties), examples (MongoDB, Redis).
•	Choosing the right database for your project.

3. Introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language)
•	Understanding the different types of SQL commands (DDL, DML, DCL).
•	Creating a database and defining tables (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE).
•	Data types in SQL.

4. CRUD Operations with SQL
Mastering the four fundamental operations required for any application:
Operation	SQL Command	Description
Create	INSERT	Adding new records to a table.
Read	SELECT	Retrieving data from a table.
Update	UPDATE	Modifying existing records.
Delete	DELETE	Removing records from a table.

5. Advanced SQL Techniques
•	Filtering: WHERE clause, logical operators (AND, OR).
•	Sorting: ORDER BY clause.
•	Grouping & Aggregation: GROUP BY, aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG).
•	Joining Tables: Understanding and using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.

6. Integrating Python with MySQL Database
•	Setting up the necessary environment and driver (e.g., mysql-connector-python).
•	Establishing a secure connection to the database.
•	Executing SQL queries from a Python script.
•	Handling query results and managing database connections.

🛠 Prerequisites
To effectively follow the materials in this repository, you should have:
•	Python: Basic to intermediate knowledge of Python programming.
•	MySQL: MySQL Server installed on your local machine.
•	IDE/Text Editor: A development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
•	Command Line/Terminal: Familiarity with basic terminal commands.
